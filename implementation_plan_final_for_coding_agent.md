# Implementation Plan – Final
## Informational Structure of Space (Research Website)

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **technical and structural implementation plan** for a research website supporting a long-term conceptual project titled *Informational Structure of Space*.

The website is **not a marketing site** and **not a publication of finalized theories**. It serves as a stable public interface for an ongoing research process.

---

## Core Design Intent (Important)

- Prioritize clarity and structure over visual impact
- Avoid speculative or autogenerated scientific claims
- Separate **structure (now)** from **content (added later)**
- Convey seriousness, caution, and long-term intent

The coding implementation should reflect these constraints.

---

## Technology Stack

- Framework: **Next.js (App Router)**
- Language: **TypeScript**
- Deployment: **Vercel**
- Styling: **Vanilla CSS only** (no Tailwind, no UI frameworks)
- Directory structure: `src/`
- Import alias: `@/*`

---

## Global Layout

### `src/app/layout.tsx`

Responsibilities:
- Define `<html>` and `<body>` structure
- Include a global navigation bar
- Apply global typography and spacing styles

Navigation links (page-level routing only):
- Home (`/`)
- Projects (`/projects`)
- Concepts (`/concepts`)
- Examples (`/examples`)
- Notes (`/notes`)
- About (`/about`)
- Support (`/support`)

⚠️ Navigation must **not** link to anchor sections within the Home page.

---

## Global Styles

### `src/app/globals.css`

Guidelines:
- Neutral, research-oriented color palette
- High readability, generous spacing
- No branding, animations, or decorative effects
- Typography-focused layout

---

## Home Page

### `src/app/page.tsx`

The Home page is implemented as a **single-page scroll layout**.

### Structure

Use semantic `<section>` elements with the following IDs:

- `hero`
- `what`
- `core`
- `not`
- `snapshot`
- `why`
- `status`
- `next`

### Content Policy

- Use **neutral placeholders only**
- Do **not** invent scientific explanations
- Avoid conclusions, claims, or persuasive language
- Content will be added manually later

The Home page acts as an **orientation layer**, not documentation.

---

## Routed Pages (Placeholders)

Create minimal placeholder pages for the following routes:

- `/projects/page.tsx` – Long-term research tracks
- `/concepts/page.tsx` – Core conceptual ideas
- `/examples/page.tsx` – Phenomenological motivations (not evidence)
- `/notes/page.tsx` – Public research notes
- `/about/page.tsx` – Background and context
- `/support/page.tsx` – Support and contact information

Each page should:
- Compile without errors
- Contain a short descriptive placeholder
- Be ready for future expansion

---

## Verification

### Automated
- `npm run build`
- No TypeScript or ESLint errors

### Manual
- Confirm navigation works across all routes
- Confirm Home page scroll behavior
- Ensure tone is neutral and non-promotional
- Confirm semantic HTML usage

---

## Final Note

This implementation intentionally enforces a boundary between:

- **Structural scaffolding (now)**
- **Research content (later)**

This separation is a core design requirement.
