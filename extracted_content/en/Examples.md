# Examples

## Section: Overview

This page clarifies how examples are used within the project. The examples presented here are not intended to prove a theory or strengthen claims. Instead, each example serves as a reference point for examining how a given phenomenon might be reinterpreted within the project's question structure.

Examples are used to test where the project's conceptual framing remains coherent, and where it may need revision.

## Double-Slit Experiment

The double-slit experiment is not treated here as a way to decide whether waves or particles are "more real."

Instead, it is used to examine whether the difference between outcomes before and after observation can be understood not as a physical collapse, but as a selection among allowed states.

This example serves as a starting point for re-examining concepts such as observation, determination, and outcome through the lenses of structure and selection.

## Gravitational Bending of Light

The bending of light by gravity is not interpreted only as the direct action of a force.

Within this project, it is used to examine whether the structure of space itself could constrain or determine the path of light, and whether an observed trajectory could appear as a consequence of structural conditions.

This example is used to test the assumption that space is not merely a background, but something with structure.

## Non-Propulsive Motion Reports

Some reported cases of non-propulsive motion raise questions about standard assumptions of motion, particularly when propulsion or reaction signatures are not observed.

In this project, such reports are not treated as evidentiary support for a factual claim or conclusion. They are used only as reference cases to motivate the conceptual question of whether motion must be explained exclusively in terms of force and continuous displacement.

## Ball Lightning

Ball lightning is a rare and not fully explained phenomenon. Rather than assigning it to a specific theoretical account, this project treats it as a reference case for exploratory consideration of whether structure could become locally observable under certain conditions.

This example is used to raise the question of whether spatial structure might, at times, appear in a transient and measurable form.

## Notes on Examples

All examples on this page are tools for asking questions, not objects to be explained.

Each example is used to probe how far the project's conceptual structure can be applied, and where it may break down. No single phenomenon is treated as sufficient to justify a conclusion on its own.
