## Section: Overview

This page outlines the primary research tracks currently being pursued within the project. Each project represents not a completed theory or set of results, but an independent cluster of questions and a provisional research direction.

All projects remain open-ended. As the research progresses, individual tracks may be expanded, merged, refined, or discontinued.

## Project 01 â€” Informational Structure of Space

**Status**: Conceptual research Â· Question formulation stage

This project focuses on the view that space should not be treated as an empty background, but as a structure filled with information. The central question is whether the structure of that information can determine the properties of space itself.

At this stage, the objective is not to formalize a model or theory, but to examine which assumptions are required to treat space as an informational structure, and whether this perspective remains conceptually coherent under scrutiny.

## Project 02 â€” Motion as Structural Reconfiguration

**Status**: Early-stage conceptual exploration

This project examines the nature of motion. Rather than presupposing motion as continuous change of position caused by applied forces, it asks whether motion could instead be understood as a process of reconfiguration or selection within the structure of space itself.

The focus here is on whether changes in position must always be explained through energy transfer, or whether alternative conceptual accounts become possible if space is treated as an informational structure.

## Project 03 â€” Observation, Selection, and Physical Outcomes

**Status**: Conceptual analysis stage

This project explores the relationship between observation and physical outcomes. Instead of treating observation as a purely external act, it considers whether observation can be understood as a process in which a particular state is selected within a structured space.

The analysis focuses on the implicit assumptions embedded in concepts such as measurement, determination, and outcome, and on how those assumptions shape physical interpretation.

## Project 04 â€” Limits, Structure, and Physical Constraints

**Status**: Exploratory research stage

This project addresses physical limits such as speed, locality, and constraint. It examines whether such limits should be regarded as fundamental constants, or whether they may instead arise as consequences of structural conditions imposed by space itself.

By treating physical constraints as products of structure rather than as primitives, this project explores how established notions of limitation might be reinterpreted.

#### Additional Research Questions

This project area includes further questions such as:

Could observed physical upper bounds (for example, the speed of light) reflect not limits on material motion, but computational or update constraints inherent to the informational structure of space?

If space is structured by information, do processes of structural editing or reconfiguration necessarily involve intrinsic limits on processing or update rates?

Do such computational constraints provide a way to reinterpret constants that are currently treated as fundamental within existing physical laws?

## Notes on Project Status

All projects listed here are ongoing. They are not intended to present finalized positions, but to record the research directions that are currently being maintained. As the work develops, some projects may be expanded, consolidated, or set aside.
